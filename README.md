# Robothon-2021-Digital-Application
We believe Robothon is a great opportunity for us to showcase our passion in Robotics by solving a great challenging problem of E waste management. We believe as engineers and researchers, its our responsibility to solve hard problems in our society to make the human existance more sustainable, by protecting our planet earth from the overuse of limited resources. This challenge will expose us to hard problems in the society that can be solved using robotics,  improve our critical thinking and collaborative thinking skills as well as presentation and networking skills. Thankyou for this great opportunity.


As suggested in the application, please find the link to the CV of both of us.

## Robot system

We have a Franka Emika Panda Robotic Arm for our research work at University of Glasgow, UK. We will be using various end effectors and vision system for the successful completion of this competition.
I have experience in developing **ROS** nodes and mapping algorithm for the teleoperation of **Franka Robotic Arm** utilising parameters of the **Opti track 3-D motion tracking** systems.
I have good exposure in integrating vision system for the **object and color detection and manipulation of the objects** using Dobot Magician Robotic Arm. I have also integrated and tested the **YOLO deep learning model** utilising the camera system of Pepper Humaniod Robot.
